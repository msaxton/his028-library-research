* Seats and study rooms may be reserved through the website.
* If you are unable to come to the library, you may request scans or have items mailed to you.


## Tips for Research

### 1. Distinguish between primary and secondary sources
* What is a primary source?
* What is a secondary source?
* Why is this distinction important?

### 2. Consult Reference sources
Reference sources (bibliographies, encyclopedias, and handbooks) provide helpful summaries, background information, and bibliographies on your topic.

* [Oxford Bibliographies Online](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=OBO)  
* [Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century](http://ezproxy.library.tufts.edu/login?auth=tufts&url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/title/galeus?tab=contents&institutionId=991)

### 3. Choose the right database(s) for your project.
* [JumboSearch, Tufts catalog, or libraries worldwide?](https://tischlibrary.tufts.edu/)
* [America: History & Life](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=AmerHistLife)
* [American State Papers 1789-1838](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=NBAmStPa1789)

### 4. Develop, expand, and track search terms.
* Use important terms from your topic or research question as keywords for searching.
* Add synonyms and/or subject terms to your keywords.
* Make note of your search terms so that you do not repeat your efforts.

Pro Tip: Subject terms for primary sources in the Tufts catalog:
* Archival Resources
* Archives
* Correspondence
* Diaries
* Facsimiles
* Notebooks
* Pamphlets
* Sources

### 5. Use Google, but use it wisely
* Google does not contain (index) all available sources.
* Google will customize your search results based your previous sources.
* Google does not rank its results based on credibility.
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is more useful for finding scholarly literature than the main Google search.

### 6. Track your citations
* Use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) or similar software to store bibliographic information.
* Develop an annotated bibliography as you compile your research.


## Evaluating and Using Sources
What qualities make for a good primary source?
What qualities make for a good secondary source?

### Considerations:
How does the author know these details (names, dates, times)? Was the author present at the event or soon on the scene?

### Considerations:
 Where does this information come from - personal experience, eyewitness accounts, or reports written by others?

 ### Considerations:
Are the author's conclusions based on a single piece of evidence, or have many sources been taken into account (e.g., diary entries, along with third-party eyewitness accounts, impressions of contemporaries, newspaper accounts)?

### BEAM model for using sources
* Background: use a source to provide general information to explain the topic.
* Exhibit: use a source as evidence or examples to analyze.
* Argument: use a source to engage its argument.
* Method: use a sourceâ€™s way of analyzing an issue to apply to your own issue.
